## ActiveGate plugin for Dynatrace
###### Author: VÃ­ctor Balbuena Pantigas


This is an ActiveGate plugin developed as an add-on for the software Dynatrace. Its purpose is to be able to check if external resources that accept connections, let it be HTTP or TCP, are up and accepting connections or are unavailable, pushing problems into Dynatrace when needed.
